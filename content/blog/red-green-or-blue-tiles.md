<p>A row of five grey square tiles is to have a number of its tiles replaced with coloured oblong tiles chosen from red (length two), green (length three), or blue (length four).</p>
<p>If red tiles are chosen there are exactly seven ways this can be done.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">

<p>If green tiles are chosen there are three ways.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img alt="png116_2.png" src="/images/p116_2.png"/></div>
<p>And if blue tiles are chosen there are two ways.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img alt="png116_3.png" src="/images/p116_3.png"/></div>
<p>Assuming that colours cannot be mixed there are 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 ways of replacing the grey tiles in a row measuring five units in length.</p>
<p>How many different ways can the grey tiles in a row measuring fifty units in length be replaced if colours cannot be mixed and at least one coloured tile must be used?</p>
