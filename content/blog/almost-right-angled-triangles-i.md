<p>Let us call an integer sided triangle with sides <var>a</var> ≤ <var>b</var> ≤ <var>c</var> <i>barely acute</i> if the sides satisfy <var>a</var><sup>2</sup> + <var>b</var><sup>2</sup> = <var>c</var><sup>2</sup> + 1.</p>
<p>How many barely acute triangles are there with perimeter ≤ 25,000,000?</p>
