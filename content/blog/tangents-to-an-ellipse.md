<p>
A definition for an ellipse is:
Given a circle c with centre M and radius r and a point G such that d(G,M)&lt;r, the locus of the points that are equidistant from c and G form an ellipse.
</p>
The construction of the points of the ellipse is shown below.

<div style="text-align:center;">

<p>
Given are the points M(-2000,1500) and G(8000,1500). 
Given is also the circle c with centre M and radius 15000.
The locus of the points that are equidistant from G and c form an ellipse e.
From a point P outside e the two tangents t<sub>1</sub> and t<sub>2</sub> to the ellipse are drawn.
Let the points where t<sub>1</sub> and t<sub>2</sub> touch the ellipse be R and S.

For how many lattice points P is angle RPS greater than 45 degrees?
