<p>You are given a pizza (perfect circle) that has been cut into <var>m</var>·<var>n</var> equal pieces and you want to have exactly one topping on each slice.</p>
<p>Let <var>f</var>(<var>m</var>,<var>n</var>) denote the number of ways you can have toppings on the pizza with <var>m</var> different toppings (<var>m</var> ≥ 2), using each topping on exactly <var>n</var> slices (<var>n</var> ≥ 1). Reflections are considered distinct, rotations are not. </p>
<p>Thus, for instance, <var>f</var>(2,1) = 1, <var>f</var>(2,2) = <var>f</var>(3,1) = 2 and <var>f</var>(3,2) = 16. <var>f</var>(3,2) is shown below:</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="p281_pizza.gif" class="dark_img" src="/images/p281_pizza.gif"/></div>
<p>Find the sum of all <var>f</var>(<var>m</var>,<var>n</var>) such that <var>f</var>(<var>m</var>,<var>n</var>) ≤ 10<sup>15</sup>.</p>
