<p>The <span style="font-style:italic;">hyperexponentiation</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">tetration</span> of a number a by a positive integer b, denoted by a↑↑b or <sup>b</sup>a, is recursively defined by:
a↑↑1 = a,
a↑↑(k+1) = a<sup>(a↑↑k)</sup>.</p>
<p>
Thus we have e.g. 3↑↑2 = 3<sup>3</sup> = 27, hence 3↑↑3 = 3<sup>27</sup> = 7625597484987 and 3↑↑4 is roughly 10<sup>3.6383346400240996*10^12</sup>.</p>
<p>Find the last 8 digits of 1777↑↑1855.</p>
