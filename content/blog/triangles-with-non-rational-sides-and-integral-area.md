<p>Consider the triangle with sides √5, √65 and √68.
It can be shown that this triangle has area 9.</p>
<p>S(n) is the sum of the areas of  all triangles with sides √(1+b<sup>2</sup>), √(1+c<sup>2</sup>) and √(b<sup>2</sup>+c<sup>2</sup>) (for positive integers b and c ) that have an integral area not exceeding n.</p>
<p>The example triangle has b=2 and c=8.</p>
<p>S(10<sup>6</sup>)=18018206.</p>
<p>Find S(10<sup>10</sup>).</p>
