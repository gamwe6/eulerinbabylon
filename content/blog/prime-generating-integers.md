<p>
Consider the divisors of 30: 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.
It can be seen that for every divisor <var>d</var> of 30, <var>d</var>+30/<var>d</var> is prime.
</p>
<p>
Find the sum of all positive integers <var>n</var> not exceeding 100 000 000such that
for every divisor <var>d</var> of <var>n</var>, <var>d</var>+<var>n</var>/<var>d</var> is prime.
