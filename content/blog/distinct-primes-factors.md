<p>The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:</p>
<p style="margin-left:100px;">14 = 2 × 715 = 3 × 5</p>
<p>The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:</p>
<p style="margin-left:100px;">644 = 2² × 7 × 23645 = 3 × 5 × 43646 = 2 × 17 × 19.</p>
<p>Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each. What is the first of these numbers?</p>
