<p>The <i>blancmange curve</i> is the set of points $(x, y)$ such that $0 \le x \le 1$ and $y = \sum \limits_{n = 0}^{\infty} {\dfrac{s(2^n x)}{2^n}}$, where $s(x)$ is the distance from $x$ to the nearest integer.</p>
<p>The area under the blancmange curve is equal to Â½, shown in pink in the diagram below.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">

<p>Let <var>C</var> be the circle with centre $\left ( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2} \right )$ and radius $\frac{1}{4}$, shown in black in the diagram.</p>
<p>What area under the blancmange curve is enclosed by <var>C</var>?Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places in the form <i>0.abcdefgh</i></p>
