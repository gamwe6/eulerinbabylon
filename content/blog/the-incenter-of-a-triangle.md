<p>
ABC is an integer sided triangle with incenter I and perimeter p.
The segments IA, IB and IC have integral length as well. 
</p>
<p>
Let L = p + |IA| + |IB| + |IC|. 
</p>
<p>
Let S(P) = ∑L for all such triangles where p ≤ P. For example, S(10<sup>3</sup>) = 3619.
</p>
<p>
Find S(10<sup>7</sup>).
