<p>Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img alt="" class="dark_img" src="/images/p015.png"/></div>
<p>How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?</p>
