<p>Given an integer sided triangle ABC:
Let I be the incenter of ABC.
Let D be the intersection between the line AI and the circumcircle of ABC (A ≠ D).</p>
<p>We define F(<var>L</var>) as the sum of BC for the triangles ABC that satisfy AC = DI and BC ≤ <var>L</var>.</p>
<p>For example, F(15) = 45 because the triangles ABC with (BC,AC,AB) = (6,4,5), (12,8,10), (12,9,7), (15,9,16) satisfy the conditions.</p>
<p>Find F(10<sup>9</sup>).</p>
