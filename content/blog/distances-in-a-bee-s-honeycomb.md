title: "Distances in a bee's honeycomb "
description: "Problem 354"

<p>Consider a honey bee's honeycomb where each cell is a perfect regular hexagon with side length 1.</p>
<div align="center">

<p>
One particular cell is occupied by the queen bee.
For a positive real number <var>L</var>, let B(<var>L</var>) count the cells with distance <var>L</var> from the queen bee cell (all distances are measured from centre to centre); you may assume that the honeycomb is large enough to accommodate for any distance we wish to consider. 
For example, B(√3) = 6, B(√21) = 12 and B(111 111 111) = 54.</p>
<p>Find the number of <var>L</var> ≤ 5·10<sup>11</sup> such that B(<var>L</var>) = 450.</p>
