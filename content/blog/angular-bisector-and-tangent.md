<p>
Given is an integer sided triangle <var>ABC</var> with <var>BC</var> ≤ <var>AC</var> ≤ <var>AB</var>.<var>k</var> is the angular bisector of angle <var>ACB</var>.<var>m</var> is the tangent at <var>C</var> to the circumscribed circle of <var>ABC</var>.<var>n</var> is a line parallel to <var>m</var> through <var>B</var>.
The intersection of <var>n</var> and <var>k</var> is called <var>E</var>.
</p>
<div align="center"><img alt="p296_bisector.gif" class="dark_img" src="/images/p296_bisector.gif"/></div>
<p>
How many triangles <var>ABC</var> with a perimeter not exceeding 100 000 exist such that <var>BE</var> has integral length?
</p>
