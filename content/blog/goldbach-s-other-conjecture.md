<p>It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.</p>
<p style="margin-left:10px;">9 = 7 + 2×1<sup>2</sup>
15 = 7 + 2×2<sup>2</sup>
21 = 3 + 2×3<sup>2</sup>
25 = 7 + 2×3<sup>2</sup>
27 = 19 + 2×2<sup>2</sup>
33 = 31 + 2×1<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>It turns out that the conjecture was false.</p>
<p>What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?</p>
