<p>
Given is the arithmetic-geometric sequence u(<var>k</var>) = (900-3<var>k</var>)<var>r</var><sup><var>k</var>-1</sup>.
Let s(<var>n</var>) = Σ<sub><var>k</var>=1...<var>n</var></sub>u(<var>k</var>).
</p>
<p>
Find the value of <var>r</var> for which s(5000) = -600,000,000,000.
</p>
<p>
Give your answer rounded to 12 places behind the decimal point.
