<p>The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + ... + 10<sup>2</sup> = 385</div>
<p>The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">(1 + 2 + ... + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 55<sup>2</sup> = 3025</div>
<p>Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.</p>
<p>Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.</p>
